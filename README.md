Successful investment strategies need to be ahead of stock market movements. Machine learning paves the way for the development of financial theories that can forecast those movements. In this work an application of the Triple-Barrier Method and Meta-Labeling techniques is explored with XGBoost for the creation of a sentiment-based trading signal on the S&P 500 stock market index. The results confirm that sentiment data have predictive power, but a lot of work is to be carried out prior to implementing a strategy.
Developed a software system that uses Machine Learning to predict stock market trends, using financial news and market sentiment as inputs.
Implemented the Triple-Barrier Method and Meta-Labeling techniques with XGBoost to generate sentiment-based trading signals for the SP 500 index and apply Object-Oriented Design principles for scalable and modular architecture.
Created interactive data dashboards using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize market trends and developed a user-friendly frontend using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, and ensured smooth performance on all browsers.
